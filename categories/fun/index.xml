      <description>We finished a indie game called &amp;ldquo;Limbo&amp;rdquo; over the weekend. Personally I like it very much, It is a short, simple, monochrome, 2D puzzle solving game. Although there is no exciting story or flashy graphic, the music and animation is outstanding, puzzles are well designed, it kept us engaged for hours.
I bought this game long time ago, never get time to try it until this Saturday I was downloading another large game, I decided to give it a try while we wait.</description>
