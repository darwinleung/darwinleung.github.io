      <description>In this blog, I am going to write a lot of math. I used Typora as my markdown editor and it supports MathJax out of the box. I just need to wrap my math blocks with $$ (following this reference). However, I will need to do a quick step to make Hugo work with MathJax as discribed in the Hugo documentation. I copied add-mathjax-to-page.html and pasted in the beginning of post_footer.</description>

      <description>We finished a indie game called &amp;ldquo;Limbo&amp;rdquo; over the weekend. Personally I like it very much, It is a short, simple, monochrome, 2D puzzle solving game. Although there is no exciting story or flashy graphic, the music and animation is outstanding, puzzles are well designed, it kept us engaged for hours.
I bought this game long time ago, never get time to try it until this Saturday I was downloading another large game, I decided to give it a try while we wait.</description>
