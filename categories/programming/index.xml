      <description>Running python 2 and 3 using conda I am taking the M101P course to brush up my Mongo skill, the course is kind of dated, it uses Python 2. However, I use Python 3 on my machine by default. I need a quick and easy way to run python 2 scripts without changing my default settings/path. I found conda offer a great out-of-box solution by using environment.
 A conda environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of conda packages that you have installed.</description>

      <description>Hugo First, I follow the quick start guide to install and set up a hugo server locally.
Customize theme Picking theme There are hundreds of themes available on the hugo site. At first, I picked hyde to start with, I like the simplistic two-column design. Hyde is originally a Jekyll theme, it was ported by the creator of Hugo @spf13. As one of the most basic and popular theme, I think it would be a good theme to begin with.</description>
